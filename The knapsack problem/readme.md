#Packing

The goal of packing problems is to find an optimal way to pack a set of items of given sizes into containers with fixed capacities. 
A typical application is loading boxes onto delivery trucks efficiently. It is not often possible to pack all the items, due to the capacity constraints. 
In that case, the problem is to find a subset of the items with maximum total size that will fit in the containers. The most known packing problem is the knapsack problem.

**Chapter 9** of my book discusses optimaztion in Operations Research (OR) and the knapsack problem is elaborated.

This kind of a packing problem falls under **integer optimization**.
