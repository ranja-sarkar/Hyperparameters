# Classification of Optimization Problems
 
 1. Linear Programming (LP) ->  Objective function and constraints are both linear
 
 2. Quadratic Programming (QP) -> Objective function is quadratic and constraints are linear
 
 3. Non-Linear Programming (NLP) -> Objective function or atleast one constraint is non-linear
